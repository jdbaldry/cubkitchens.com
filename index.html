<p>A number of customers have paid large deposits to Cub Kitchens, oni,
and Bearhaus and received nothing in return.</p>
<p>If you’re a customer of Cub Kitchens, Cubly, Bearhaus, Load Bear,
oni, or any other trading names of <a
href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12416577">Green
2020 Ltd</a> or <a
href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/16450946">Squirrel
Kitchens Ltd</a>, send me an <a

<h2 id="known-sites">Known sites</h2>
<p>Green 2020 Ltd and Squirrel Kitchens Ltd have a number of sites. You
can see some of the older site iterations on the <a

<p>There are four unsatisfied records outstanding against Green 2020
Ltd. I’m not allowed to share the report but you can confirm it yourself
using <a
href="https://search.trustonline.org.uk/Search/Business">TrustOnline</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fake-reviews">Fake reviews</h2>
<p>Cub Kitchens posted an AI generated review on <a
href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eCfu9LEjRGwJoddBA">Google Maps</a> and <a
href="https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68eced71f35305802a92430b">Trustpilot</a>
to try and offset the negative reviews they’ve been receiving from
customers still waiting for a refund on their undelivered kitchens.</p>
<p>Put the text into any AI checking tool and it will flag it as fake.
You can do the same to all the negative reviews and see that they’re all
clearly real human experiences.</p>
<p>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 makes it
illegal to post fake reviews and requires businesses to take reasonable
steps to prevent and remove them. I’ve notified Cub Kitchens of the fake
review and they’ve insisted it’s legitimate. It seems odd for a
legitimate customer to leave an AI generated review with no pictures
instead of their own experience.</p>
<h2 id="winding-up-petition">Winding up petition</h2>
<p>There’s a winding up petition issued against <a
href="https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/4973248">Green 2020 Ltd</a>
petitioned by solicitors on behalf of Stark Building Materials (owners
of Jewson and other brands). I attended the hearing which was adjourned
to 10th December 2025.</p>
