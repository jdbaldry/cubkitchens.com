There are four unsatisfied records outstanding against Green 2020 Ltd.
I'm not allowed to share the report but you can confirm it yourself using [TrustOnline](https://search.trustonline.org.uk/Search/Business).

## Fake reviews

Cub Kitchens posted an AI generated review on [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eCfu9LEjRGwJoddBA) and [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68eced71f35305802a92430b) to try and offset the negative reviews they've been receiving from customers still waiting for a refund on their undelivered kitchens.

Put the text into any AI checking tool and it will flag it as fake.
You can do the same to all the negative reviews and see that they're all clearly real human experiences.

The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 makes it illegal to post fake reviews and requires businesses to take reasonable steps to prevent and remove them.
I've notified Cub Kitchens of the fake review and they've insisted it's legitimate.
It seems odd for a legitimate customer to leave an AI generated review with no pictures instead of their own experience.

## Winding up petition

There's a winding up petition issued against [Green 2020 Ltd](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/4973248) petitioned by solicitors on behalf of Stark Building Materials (owners of Jewson and other brands).
I attended the hearing which was adjourned to 10th December 2025.
